# Face-detection

In this project, I utilized the OpenCV library and Haar cascades to create a face detection system. Haar cascades are machine learning classifiers that have been trained to recognize specific features in images, such as faces. By using pre-trained Haar cascades, I was able to enhance the performance and accuracy of my system. This project has numerous potential applications, including security systems, social media, and human-computer interaction
